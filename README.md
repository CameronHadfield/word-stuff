# Words with Python
This repo contains various scripts for analyzing language! Just some things I have been doing as a curiosity

Current works:
## Longest Unique Lettering
A script to find the longest string in a CRLF separated text file that has no repeated characters! (fun fact, in the english language, that word is dermatoglyphics!)

##  requency analysis
Takes a piece of text and performs frequency analysis. That is, takes a text and spits out a result representing the number of occurrences of each letter, as well as their distribution
